-Designed a circuit using BJTs while maintaining specific requirements, while testing inverting/non-inverting transistor amplification as well as single-stage and multistage amplifiers using NI Multisim.

-There is a Multisim file included of the circuit I designed and implemented

-There is a final report of all the calculations and theory behind the design of the circuit and conclusions.
